# B200 offline: ShareGPT EAGLE-3 pretrain → DAPO policy-lag analysis

This folder is self-contained with respect to project source code.  It vendors
`sgl-project/SpecForge@3cb0510f0bd0e8c195ac6e9c5c62f6b50580ff83` under
`third_party/SpecForge`; the B200 machine does not need Git or Internet access.
CUDA/PyTorch/SGLang binaries are not vendored: the offline image must already
provide the versions in `DEPENDENCIES_POLICY_LAG.md` (or an administrator must
provide a local wheelhouse).

Expected placement:

```text
/workspace/storage-shared/nlp/minhpn19/
├── SpecNaacl/                        # this entire folder
└── data/
    ├── sharegpt/ShareGPT_V4.3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json
    └── DAPO-Math-17k-Processed/en/train-00000-of-00001.parquet
```

The target model path is the source of truth. The default is
`/workspace/storage-shared/models/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`; set only
`TARGET_MODEL_PATH` to use another local compatible Qwen2/Qwen2.5
checkpoint. The launcher reads that model's `config.json` and generates the
matching one-layer EAGLE-3 config and capture layers automatically.

## Commands

Install and activate the offline Python 3.12 environment from `ENVIRONMENT.md`,
then run both stages:

```bash
cd /workspace/storage-shared/nlp/minhpn19/SpecNaacl
source .venv-offline/bin/activate
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python)" bash run_b200_policy_lag_pipeline.sh
```

For Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct:

```bash
TARGET_MODEL_PATH=/workspace/storage-shared/models/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct \
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python)" \
bash run_b200_policy_lag_pipeline.sh
```

Install the exact Python 3.12 / Torch 2.13.0 CUDA 13.0 / Transformers 5.12.1 /
SGLang 0.5.18 stack from `ENVIRONMENT.md`. Before loading the model the launcher
checks the concrete EAGLE-3, FlexAttention, and SGLang capture APIs and records
the actual versions in `<run-directory>/dependencies.json`. A missing optional
`flash_attn` v2 import is a warning; SpecForge then uses PyTorch FlexAttention.

For Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, only change the path:

```bash
TARGET_MODEL_PATH=/workspace/storage-shared/models/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python)" \
bash run_b200_policy_lag_pipeline.sh
```

The model directory basename becomes a filesystem-safe model slug. Every
pretrain invocation receives a UTC timestamp with nanoseconds in its run ID,
so runs do not overwrite one another. On success, stable `latest_*` symlinks
are updated. The analysis launcher reads the latest completed run manifest and
therefore does not need the run ID copied by hand.

Or run separately:

```bash
TARGET_MODEL_PATH=/workspace/storage-shared/models/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct \
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python)" \
bash pretrain_eagle3_sharegpt_b200.sh

PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python)" bash run_policy_lag_analysis_b200.sh
```

The first command converts the local ShareGPT JSON, captures the exact
SpecForge EAGLE-3 teacher tensors, creates one fixed vocabulary mapping, and
trains one epoch. It uses explicit random initialization by default. To warm
start instead, set both `DRAFT_INITIALIZATION_MODE=pretrained` and
`INITIAL_DRAFT_CHECKPOINT=/absolute/local/checkpoint`.

The second command deterministically shuffles the English DAPO parquet with
seed 42, uses exactly 5,000 rows as the GRPO/analysis training pool, and takes
512 different rows as the held-out pool. Sixteen held-out prompts are evaluated
per boundary by default; set `EVAL_PROMPTS` up to 512 to change this without
allowing train/eval overlap.

Useful B200 overrides:

```bash
CAPTURE_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 \
CAPTURE_NPROC_PER_NODE=2 \
TRAIN_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 \
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 \
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python)" \
bash run_b200_policy_lag_pipeline.sh
```

Feature capture can use multiple data-parallel workers. The SpecForge trainer
can also use multiple GPUs by setting matching `TRAIN_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and
`PRETRAIN_NPROC_PER_NODE`. FastGRPO rollout/verification remains the upstream
single-process decoder and therefore intentionally uses one GPU.

## Outputs

DAPO split and policy-lag results:

```text
/workspace/storage-shared/nlp/minhpn19/outputs/fastgrpo/policy_lag/
├── dapo_math_seed42/{train.jsonl,eval.jsonl,split_manifest.json}
└── qwen2_5_3b_instruct/<pretrain-run-id>_dapo5k/
    ├── analysis/{per_response.jsonl,summary.jsonl,summary.csv,aal_policy_lag.png}
    ├── analysis/boundaries/step_*/{phi_base.pt,draft_stale.pt,draft_fresh.pt,complete.json}
    ├── checkpoints/latest.pt
    └── logs/{console.log,train.jsonl,summary.json,summary.txt}
```

Successful stages are reused. `RESUME_PRETRAIN=true`, `RESUME=true`, and
`ANALYSIS_RESUME=true` are defaults. Use a new output directory for a genuinely
new experiment instead of overwriting an existing run.
